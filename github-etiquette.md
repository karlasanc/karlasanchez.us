/* Include rules that need to be followed when working with the repo*/
- Keep file paths short and sensible
- Don't use funky characters and spaces in your file names
- Always *pull before* you start working on your project and *before you push* in case someone has done any work since the last time you pulled - you wounldn't want anyone's work to get lost or have to resolve many coding conflicts.
